This is the source code to [my portfolio website](http://cimmanon.org/).  It replaces my portfolio's hand-coded markup that's been limping along since 2002.  It's not just for web designs, though, it can accomodate coding or any other type of project I might want to do.  In addition to being able to write up a little blurb and upload screenshots, the ArchiveServe will serve up past web designs in all of their original glory.

I originally started rewriting/redesigning the site in February 2014.  Then I got busy with a new job and ended up never having time to work on it.  A few months later, I had a hard drive failure lost everything but a small HTML/CSS demo I had uploaded to my webserver.  I didn't think that what I had written so far was at a point where I wanted anyone to see it, so I kept it entirely local.  Lesson learned.

This version was started at the end of December 2015 and launched January 26, 2015.  About half of the design choices I made in the original version made it into this version.
